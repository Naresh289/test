Mortgage Default Risk Prediction Model
Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model for mortgage default risk using a synthetic dataset. The model leverages various data science techniques, including feature engineering, feature selection, and advanced machine learning algorithms, to assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on their mortgage.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a Synthetic Mortgage Performance Dataset, containing the following key features:

Loan ID: Unique identifier for each loan.
Borrower Age: Age of the borrower.
Income Level: Annual income of the borrower.
Credit Score: Credit score of the borrower.
Loan Amount: Total loan amount.
Property Value: Value of the property being mortgaged.
Loan-to-Value Ratio: Ratio of the loan amount to the property value.
Employment Status: Borrower's employment status.
Payment History: History of loan payments.
Economic Indicators: Various macroeconomic factors like GDP growth, unemployment rate, etc.
Default Status: Target variable indicating whether the borrower defaulted (1) or not (0).
Steps in the Model Development
1. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Missing values in economic indicators were filled using the forward fill (ffill) method.
Feature Scaling: All numerical features were scaled to ensure fair contribution to the model.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical variables were encoded appropriately.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed to understand data distributions, correlations, and potential outliers.
2. Feature Engineering
Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio: Calculated to assess the borrower's debt relative to income.
Credit Utilization: Removed due to redundancy.
Economic Stress Indicator: Derived using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on macroeconomic factors like GDP growth, unemployment rate, interest rate, and inflation rate.
Credit History Relative to Loan Issue Date: Derived to evaluate the relevance of the borrower's credit history to the loan.
3. Feature Selection
A custom function remove_highly_correlated_features was implemented to remove features with a correlation greater than 0.8, ensuring that only the most impactful and independent features were retained.
4. Model Development
Implemented the following models to predict mortgage default risk:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost Classifier
(Optional Advanced) Neural Network
5. Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

Precision: The proportion of true positives among all positive predictions.
Recall: The proportion of true positives among actual positives.
ROC-AUC Curve: Measures the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between default and non-default.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix to visualize true vs. predicted classifications.
Feature Importance: Analyzed to understand the most influential features in the prediction.
6. Advanced Features
Cross-Validation: Applied to ensure the models' robustness.
Model Interpretability Report: Generated to provide insights into how models make predictions.
Risk Scoring Mechanism: Developed for quantifying default risk.
Business Recommendations: Provided actionable insights to improve business decisions.
