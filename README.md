# üè† Mortgage Default Risk Prediction Model

## üìñ Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model for **mortgage default risk** using a synthetic dataset. The model leverages various data science techniques, including **feature engineering**, **feature selection**, and **advanced machine learning algorithms**, to assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on their mortgage. üìä

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a **Synthetic Mortgage Performance Dataset**, containing the following key features:

- **Loan ID**: Unique identifier for each loan.
- **Borrower Age**: Age of the borrower.
- **Income Level**: Annual income of the borrower.
- **Credit Score**: Credit score of the borrower.
- **Loan Amount**: Total loan amount.
- **Property Value**: Value of the property being mortgaged.
- **Loan-to-Value Ratio**: Ratio of the loan amount to the property value.
- **Employment Status**: Borrower's employment status.
- **Payment History**: History of loan payments.
- **Economic Indicators**: Various macroeconomic factors like GDP growth, unemployment rate, etc.
- **Default Status**: Target variable indicating whether the borrower defaulted (`1`) or not (`0`).

## üîß Steps in the Model Development

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Filled missing economic indicator values using the forward fill (`ffill`) method.
- **Feature Scaling**: Applied scaling to all numerical features to ensure fair contribution to the model.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Encoded categorical variables appropriately.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted to understand data distributions, correlations, and potential outliers.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering
- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**: Calculated to assess the borrower's debt relative to income.
- **Credit Utilization**: Removed due to redundancy.
- **Economic Stress Indicator**: Derived using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on macroeconomic factors like GDP growth, unemployment rate, interest rate, and inflation rate.
- **Credit History Relative to Loan Issue Date**: Evaluated the relevance of the borrower‚Äôs credit history to the loan.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Selection
Implemented a custom function `remove_highly_correlated_features` to remove features with a correlation greater than `0.8`, ensuring that only the most impactful and independent features were retained.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development
Built and tested the following machine learning models to predict mortgage default risk:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**
- *(Optional Advanced)* **Neural Network**

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Precision**: Proportion of true positives among all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positives among actual positives.
- **ROC-AUC Curve**: Measures the model‚Äôs ability to distinguish between default and non-default cases.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes true vs. predicted classifications.
- **Feature Importance**: Identified the most influential features in the prediction.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Features
- **Cross-Validation**: Applied to ensure the models' robustness.
- **Model Interpretability Report**: Provided insights into how models make predictions.
- **Risk Scoring Mechanism**: Developed a system for quantifying default risk.
- **Business Recommendations**: Suggested actionable insights to improve decision-making.
